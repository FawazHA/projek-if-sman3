                    <h2>THE_P.AI.NTER</h2>
                    <p>The p.AI.nter, also known as Z-779, is a sentient AI and a threat in Pressure,
                        acting as one of the many enemies the player will encounter as they venture
                        through the Hadal Blacksite.
                        Having been coded by ███████ ███████████████, it was captured by Urbanshade
                        employees due to the surprisingly high quality of the art it creates. After these 
                        employees were demoted to LR-P for the unapproved murder of the AI's creator, it has 
                        been forced to mine Roblux for Urbanshade, as they had no other use for it.</p>
