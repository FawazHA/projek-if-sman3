                                <p>Z-367, codenamed "Pandemonium" is a monster in Pressure, acting as one of the most dangerous threats found in the Hadal Blacksite.</p>
                                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                                <p>Pandemonium takes the appearance of a melting, heavily distorted face made of flesh. It has two glowing sunken eyes and several smaller eyes inside of its mouth, which will remain darkened until it spots a player. Pandemonium's jaw is warped into a curved shape with numerous disfigured, loose teeth. Similar to <a href="angler.html">Angler</a>, Pandemonium's face will always be facing the player, regardless of where they view it.</p>
                                <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                                <li>Pandemonium acts similarly to <a href="angler.html">Angler</a> and its variants. Pandemonium has a chance to spawn if the player's current or previous room has a valid hiding spot. When Pandemonium spawns, nearby lights will flicker briefly and Pandemonium will begin advancing. Once a player gets within Pandemonium's line of sight, its eyes will light up and it will begin screeching loudly, breaking away from its path to advance directly towards the player, regardless of the distance. Pandemonium's raycast goes towards the player's head, and will not kill anyone whose head is fully submerged.</li>
                                <li>Pandemonium will instantly kill any players who are not hiding on contact.</li>
                                <li>If the player is in a locker that is within Pandemonium's line of sight, it will advance towards the player's locker and they will be forced into a minigame. This minigame requires them to keep their cursor in the middle of the screen while Pandemonium attacks the locker, which causes their cursor to jump in random directions.</li>
                                <li>While the player's cursor is away from the middle of the screen, they will lose energy, as indicated by the bar below the middle point turning red and shrinking. They can regain energy by keeping their cursor on the point. If they run out of energy, Pandemonium will force the locker open and kill them. After roughly 40 seconds, Pandemonium will leave and the minigame will end.</li>
                                <h3>Notes</h3>
                                <li>Pandemonium will only spawn after room 19.</li>
                                <li>Pandemonium is the second slowest node entity, being slightly faster than Chainsmoker. But when it detects the player, its speed increases significantly, making it faster than Angler, but still slower than Blitz.                                </li>
                                <li>After a player spends a set amount of time in a room, there is a chance for Pandemonium or any other node monster to spawn. This is called a timer spawn.</li>
                                <li>Angler and other node monsters can spawn right after a Pandemonium attack.</li>
                                <li>The sound from Pandemonium as it advances is much less intense compared to the node monsters, as it only screeches once it spots a player.</li>
