                            <ul class="mainarticletext">
                                <p>The Ridge is the final stretch of the game, located past the catwalk at Room 100. It consists of cavernous areas filled with various equipment and building materials. In The Ridge, lights frequently go out, making the area considerably more dangerous. It lasts for 13 rooms, including room 100, the crystal room, and the security checkpoint[1], and serves as an endurance run, with frequent monster spawns and scarce hiding spots.</p>
                                <li><h3>Crystal Room</h3></li>
                                <p>The Crystal Room is a location in Pressure, housing a crystal with codename Z-2. Players are tasked with retrieving this crystal, which powers the Hadal Blacksite, as a part of the "Expendable" Protocol. It is located on the edge of The Ridge. Upon taking out the crystal, acting as the primary power source for the Blacksite, the lights begin malfunctioning and the PA system goes offline.</p>
                                
                                <li><h3>Notes</h3></li>
                                    <h4>Node Monsters</h4>
                                    <li>In The Ridge, lights do not flicker to signal an incoming node monster. Instead, audio cues made by node monsters can be heard earlier, giving the player enough time to react.
                                        Node monsters spawn more frequently in The Ridge. Unlike the previous 100 rooms, in The Ridge, node entity spawning is based on a timer. The length of the timer is randomised, however.</li>
                                    <h4>Other Monsters</h4>
                                    <li>There is a green light above the safe door in the Crystal Room, easily distinguishing it from the Good People doors that will always spawn there.</li>
                                    <li>Eyefestation, Good People, Squiddles, and Wall Dwellers spawn in The Ridge at a more frequent rate.                                    </li>
                                    <li>Wall Dwellers are of little issue, however, as node monsters spawn often, often eliminating Wall Dwellers.</li>
                                    <li>While doors are not marked with numbers, Good People doors in The Ridge have louder sound cues which can be heard from a larger distance. They also have light shining out underneath their doors.</li>
                                    <li>Throughout The Ridge, hijacked speakers can spawn, causing the PDG to detonate if players stand near them for too long. They can be identified by their red glow, unique music, and a subtitle above the player's hotbar warning you when you stray too close to one.</li>
                                    <li>There is a small chance of encountering a room containing a vehicle mounted with a hijacked turret. While it cannot be deactivated, you can avoid its line of sight by walking in the same direction as its rotation.</li>
                                    <h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
                                    <li>Once a player reaches room 100, no monsters can spawn until the room after The Ridge's beginning checkpoint is opened.</li>
                                    <li>Once the player reaches the final room of The Ridge and pulls the airlock lever, Achievements such as 'We Die In The Dark' and 'We Didn't Playtest To Make Sure This Was Possible' are awarded, if the player completed them.</li>
                                    <li>In the final Ridge room, the External Repellent System document can be found laying on a shelf.</li>
