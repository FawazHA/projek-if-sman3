                                <p>The Let-Vand Zone is a fictitious oceanic zone hidden away from the rest of the world. It begins at 67,320 studs (19.06km) deep, and ends when it reaches the sea floor at 76,400 studs (roughly 20.5km) deep, making it by far the deepest zone in the ocean. (For reference, the deepest oceanic zone in real life, the Hadalpelagic Zone, begins at 6km deep, and ends at 11km deep.) The Let-Vand Zone hosts a special phenomenon where the water pressure shifts from that of the deep ocean, to that of a swimming pool. The Veil of the Let-Vand Zone is the point at which the pressure shifts. In order to pass into or out of the Let-Vand Zone, one must first get past it. This, however, is normally impossible, as the sudden pressure change would instantly crush any living being. Urbanshade's solution to this problem is to outfit their deep-sea submarines with jet engines that can reach up to 2.3 million studs per hour, allowing them to easily bypass the veil.</p>
                                <li><h3>The Hadal Blacksite</h3></li>
                                <p>Urbanshade first discovered the Let-Vand Zone after recovery teams originally sent to recover a B-Class cargo ship that had sunk during a storm east of Iceland had discovered a previously unknown abyssal trench. After learning of the Let-Vand Zone's unique properties, Urbanshade quickly blacklisted any information before it could make it to the public, and began constructing the Hadal Blacksite. The Let-Vand Zone was the perfect spot for the Hadal Blacksite, since the isolation allowed Urbanshade to freely experiment without fear of regulations from Health and Safety organizations. The isolation also ensures that, in the event of a breach, no information would be leaked.</p>
                                <li><h3>Fauna</h3></li>
                                <p>Despite being thousands of studs below sea level, the Let-Vand Zone does contain life. Documented fauna include:</p>
