                        <h2>Explore the Unknown.</h2>
                        <p>Urbanshade was founded by Mr. Shade in 19?? in order to make profit. In 1961, to the West of Iceland in the Norwegian Sea,
                            a B-class cargo ship had sank into the ocean. The recovery team later found a previously unknown deep trench. Mr. Shade,
                            knowing this information, quickly commanded personnels to cover the site, making sure the new information never reach public knowledge. 
                            The trench was then dubbed The Let-Vand Zone.
                            With the Let-Vand Zone secured, Urbanshade founded the Hadal Division and begin construction of the Hadal Blacksite in 1962, 
                            with construction finishing in 1974. Due to the Blacksite being located far underwater, no governmental powers are able to manipulate it other than Urbanshade itself. 
                            No form of life is present in Let-Vand Zone other than Parasites and Searchlights. A Submarine Bay was built on the surface in the Faroe Islands as a convenient method to get to the Blacksite, also functioning as a supply hub.
