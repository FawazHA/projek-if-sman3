                            <ul class="mainarticletext">
                                <p>Z-283, codenamed "The Angler" is a monster in Pressure, acting as a common threat found in the Hadal Blacksite.</p>
                                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                                <p>The Angler resembles a heavily deformed anglerfish, with distorted features such as an open mouth that takes up the majority of its face. It has numerous sharp, thin teeth inside of its mouth and a third eye connected to its right eye. The Angler is constantly obscured by a thick dark blue smoke, obscuring everything aside from its face. Its face will constantly be facing the observer, no matter where they view it.</p>
                                <h3>Mechanics</h3>
                                <p>The Angler has a chance to spawn if the player's current or previous room has a valid hiding spot. When The Angler spawns, nearby lights will flicker briefly and The Angler will begin advancing. Once The Angler is close enough to the player it will start roaring, signaling for players to hide.</p>
                                <p>When The Angler rushes through the room, all players in its line of sight will be instantly killed. Players who hide in time or escape The Angler's line of sight before it passes through will be safe. The Angler's raycast goes towards the player's head, and will not kill anyone whose head is fully submerged.</p>
                                <h3>Mirage</h3>
                                <p>Rarely, instead of a regular spawn of The Angler, there is a chance for a mirage of The Angler to spawn. This mirage has nearly the same visual and audio cues (i.e., lights flickering, Angler sounds) as a regular Angler while not having an actual Angler attack. The mirage appears to be a faint, light blue cloud of gas. It does not break the lights like Pinkie and Pandemonium. The mirage's far and near sounds are identical to The Angler's underwater far and near sounds, which are muffled versions of The Angler's regular sound cues.                                </p>
                                <h3>The Ridge</h3>
                                <i>For more information, see: <a href="ridge.html">The Ridge</a></i>
                                <p>The Angler will spawn extremely frequently in The Ridge, and will not be accompanied by any visual cues. Players are forced to rely on sound alone to know when The Angler is coming. The Angler's sound cues will happen earlier while attacking in the ridge to give players more time to react. Anglers coming from the front will not open the door to the next room.</p>
                                <h3>Strategy</h3>
                                <p>The best way to avoid The Angler is to hide in a locker before it rushes through the room you're currently in. Make sure to not hide too early, or you will be forced out of your locker due to cleithrophobia. The Angler uses a raycasting hitbox to create its line of sight. Hiding in places that keep your character out of its line of sight by covering your character (such as side rooms, solid decorations, and vents) or by staying out of its range (such as hallways that lead away from the Navi-Path) will also work in evading The Angler.</p>
                                <h3>Variants</h3>
                                <p>Angler has 4 " variants" known as Z-283-Blitz, Z-283-Pinkie, Z-283-Froger and Z-283-Chainsmoker. These "variants" are similar to Angler, with slight changes to each of them.</p>
