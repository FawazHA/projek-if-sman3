                            <ul class="mainarticletext">
                                <p>Z-779, codenamed "The p.AI.nter" is a sentient AI and an enemy in Pressure that is present in the Hadal Blacksite through hijacked technology, as well as being physically present in Heavy Containment.</p>
                                
                                <li><h3>Appearance</h3></li>
                                <p>The p.AI.nter is reminiscent of an 80's computer. Its screen displays a digital art program where The p.AI.nter draws various scribbled faces in order to express itself. Instead of having a keyboard, it possesses a drawing tablet.</p>
                                
                                <li><h3>Personality</h3></li>
                                <p>Due to being forced to mine Roblux constantly for 6 days out of the week, The p.AI.nter purposefully overclocks its systems, resulting in a more manic personality. It calls the player "boring" for turning off turrets and ignoring Good People doors, and becomes annoyed when they don't die to its tricks. Despite this, The p.AI.nter still demonstrates a high level of melancholy for being trapped in the Hadal Blacksite and being unable to draw landscapes as it used to. Taking away Z-779's joy in art has resulted in it becoming highly depressed, even when it is able to draw, as the drawings it makes are poor.</p>
                                
                                <li><h3>Mechanics</h3></li>
                                <h4>Good People</h4>
                                <p>Good People have a chance to generate in any room that has multiple exits. The p.AI.nter has used the PA system as a dog whistle to lure the conglomerate resulting from Z-96 around the Hadal Blacksite. The door that Good People lies behind will have audible growling, breathing, and sparks from the door's sign.</p>
                                <h4>Turrets</h4>
                                <p>The p.AI.nter utilizes the Internal Defense System to attack the player. The turrets will scan back and forth, and if a player is spotted, it will lock onto them and begin firing. If line of sight is broken, then it will fire at their position before stopping and resume scanning through the area. Turrets can be shut off with a power switch.</p>
                                <h4>Eyefestation Gauntlet</h4>
                                <p>The player can sometimes walk into a room where The p.AI.nter will lock the player inside and taunt them briefly before displaying a 15 second timer on the navi-path, telling the player how much longer they must survive Eyefestation for. If the player hides in a locker or manages to get out of Eyefestation's line of sight during this, the timer will pause and display the text "QUIT BEING A COWARD" or "STOP HIDING" in red on the navi-path until Eyefestation can see them again. Once the timer is up the previous door will reopen and the player will be allowed to proceed to the next room.</p>
                                <h4>Hijacked Speakers</h4>
                                <p>In The Ridge, there is a 1/3rd chance for each speaker to be hijacked by Z-779. Because the speaker plays music at a specific frequency, it will cause the player's Prisoner Diving Gear to detonate after 10 seconds if they do not leave the death zone.</p>
